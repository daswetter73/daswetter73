### Hi there 👋

As a front-end developer, I am motivated by the challenge of solving programming problems and improving my skillset.<br/> 
I am always open to industry opportunities and passionate about exciting projects.

🍩 I’m currently working on [Donat.Pool](https://github.com/fullstack-development/donat-pool-frontend)
